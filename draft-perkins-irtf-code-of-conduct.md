--- abstract

This document describes the code of conduct for participants in the
Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).

The IRTF believes that research is most effective when done in an open
and inclusive forum that encourages diversity of ideas and diversity of
participation.
Through this code of conduct, the IRTF will continue to strive to create
and maintain an environment that encourages broad participation, and one
in which people are treated with dignity, decency, and respect.

This document is a product of the Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG).

# Introduction

The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) promotes research of importance
to the evolution and deployment of the Internet protocols, applications,
architecture and technology, and to understand the development of the
Internet in all its diversity and for all its users, considering the
technical, economic, and societal challenges of such development.
The IRTF focuses on longer-term research issues related to the Internet
while the parallel organisation, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),
focuses on the shorter-term issues of engineering and standards-making.

The IRTF believes that research is most effective when done in an open
and inclusive forum that encourages diversity of ideas and diversity of
participation.
Through this code of conduct, the IRTF will continue to strive to create
and maintain an environment that encourages broad participation, and one
in which people are treated with dignity, decency, and respect.

This document represents the consensus of the Internet Research Steering
Group (IRSG).  It is not an IETF product and is not a standard.

# Rationale

The IRTF is not the IETF. While the two organisations work closely
together, and often co-locate meetings and other activities, they have
different goals and work in different ways.

The IETF is a consensus-driven standards-developing organisation, where
participants use their best engineering judgment to find the best solution
for the whole Internet, as it stands today, and to develop the best
technical standards to make the Internet work better.
IRTF research can be more speculative, and takes a longer-term view of
the development of the Internet without the requirements for consensus
or near-term applicability and deployability that come from standards
development. A further discussion of the differences between IRTF and
IETF can be found in [RFC7418].

Compared to the IETF equivalent [RFC7154], this IRTF code of conduct
reflects those differences in emphasis between the two organisations.



# Conduct

The IRTF is committed to providing a safe and equitable experience for all
participants. Those participating in the IRTF must extend respect and
courtesy to others at all times.

Harassment is behaviour that is unwelcome, hostile, or intimidating.
Harassment includes, in particular, speech or behaviour that is sexually
aggressive or that intimidates based on attributes such as education, race,
gender, religion, age, colour, national origin, ancestry, disability,
medical condition, sexual orientation, or gender identity [RFC7776].

Examples of harassment
include, but are not limited to, the use of offensive language or sexual
imagery, degrading verbal comments,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Harassment will not be tolerated in IRTF research group meetings, open
meetings, conferences, workshops, other events, mailing lists, virtual meeting, or other online
forums. Participants must follow the IETF anti-harassment policy which also
applies to the IRTF [ANTI-HARASSMENT].

Participants who believe they have been harassed, notice that someone else is being
harassed, or have any other concerns relating to potential harassment or
conduct, are encouraged to raise their
concern with the relevant Research Group Chair or the IRTF Chair, or with the
Ombudsteam [OMBUDSTEAM] who work on an independent and confidential basis.
All such concerns will be seriously considered, and action will be taken as
appropriate, up to and including the exclusion of the offending party from IRTF
activities.

The IRTF sometimes organises meetings or activities that co-locate with
events organised by others. These meetings or activities may need to follow
the anti-harassment policy of the hosting event, which may differ from that
of the IRTF. In such cases, the organisers of the IRTF meeting or activity
should check with the IRTF Chair to confirm that the policy is acceptable
and it should be made clear to participants what policy applies.

The IRTF operates and makes use of a number of mailing lists and other
online discussion forums. At the time of this writing, Research Group
chairs act as moderators for such forums used by their research groups
and the IRTF Chair moderates IRTF-wide lists and discussion forums.
Other moderators may be appointed in the future.
Harassment or disruption due to the
posting of messages that are inflammatory, abusive, or otherwise
inappropriate, or the repeated posting of off-topic material, on these lists
and discussion forums will not be tolerated.
Moderators will respond to harassing or disruptive behaviour with either a
warning, by temporarily suspending posting rights, or after approval from
the IRTF Chair by permanently suspending posting rights for an individual,
based on the seriousness and history of the behaviour.

Participants who have concerns about, or wish to appeal against, a moderation decision
should raise their concerns with the IRTF Chair. If
the concern relates to moderation decisions taken by the IRTF Chair, then it
should be raised with the Chair of the Internet Architecture Board.
These parties will review the situation and may reverse the
moderation decision or take other action as appropriate.

# Language and Imagery

English is the de facto language in which the IRTF works, but is not the
native language of many IRTF participants. All participants, particularly
those with English as a first language, should attempt to accommodate the
needs of others by communicating clearly.
Reading, writing, and conversing in a language where one is not a native
speaker may be difficult, and IRTF participants should treat those doing
so with grace and understanding.

Participants should aim to speak slowly and clearly in presentations and
discussions, and should strive to make presentations and other materials
accessible to those with impaired vision or disabilities. Participants
should also avoid the use of slang and unnecessary jargon in both spoken
and written communication. When faced with English that may be difficult to
understand, IRTF participants should make a sincere effort to understand
each other and to engage in conversation to clarify when necessary.

Participants should ensure that language and imagery used in IRTF
documents, presentations, mailing lists, research group meetings, open meetings,
conferences, workshops, and other events, are respectful and inclusive.
Effective research uses terminology that is clear, precise, and widely
accessible to readers from varying backgrounds and cultures.  Participants
are encouraged to follow the guidance on inclusive language in [NISTIR8366]
when making contributions to the IRTF [INCLUSIVE].


# Academic Integrity

Participants must act with respect, honesty, transparency, and fairness.
They should be trustworthy, aspire to objectivity, and aim to provide factual
evidence in support of their claims and justification for their reasoning.
They should be generous, give credit to others where it is due, and
recognise that understanding advances through collaborative research
efforts of many, rather than for the glory of a few.

Plagiarism, misrepresentation of authorship, and
content falsification constitute dishonesty and fraud. Such actions are
prohibited and the IRTF may take action against authors who commit them
including retraction of the published work or exclusion of the offending
party from IRTF activities.

The use of automated systems, for example, large language models and other
AI-based tools, to generate all or part of the content of a document,
paper, presentation, or other submission to the IRTF must be documented
and credited such that it is clear what parts were generated by the
automated system. Using such tools without credit is considered a
misrepresentation of authorship.

The IRTF publishes informational and experimental documents in the RFC
series. The nature of these documents, and their preceding internet-drafts,
is that they often extend or elaborate upon previously published research
results, to support ongoing development and experimentation by the IRTF
community. These documents are encouraged as an important part of the
process of disseminating research ideas and ensuring that they work in
the Internet at large, but authors must ensure that prior work on which
they are based, including their own prior work, is appropriately cited and
acknowledged, and that such documents respect the copyright of prior work
and are written with the permission of any co-authors.

IRTF documents may represent the views of their authors or they may be
consensus documents representing the views of a research group. It is a
misrepresentation for authors to falsely claim that a document represents
the consensus view of a research group.  Similarly, the editors of a
research group consensus document must not misrepresent their role as that
of authors.


# Research Ethics

Participants must ensure that their research, in particular research that
involves human subjects or personal data, is conducted ethically and with
respect for persons, in careful consideration of the risks and benefits
of the work,
taking care to ensure that those who bear the risk also gain some benefit,
and with respect for the law and public interest.

Participants should consult with their organisation's Institutional Review
Board, Research Ethics Committee, or similar, prior to conducting research
that might raise ethical concerns.

Participants are referred to the guidance in the Menlo Report [MENLO], the
Belmont Report [BELMONT], and the ACM Policy on Research Involving Human
Participants and Subjects [ACM] for further discussion of issues around
ethical conduct of research.


# Participation and Accessibility


To encourage broad participation, and support the goal of providing an
open and inclusive forum that encourages diversity of ideas and diversity
of participation, IRTF participants
should consider accessibility and access-related concerns when organising
research group meetings, open meetings, conferences, workshops, and other events to
ensure such events are broadly accessible to all who wish to participate.

Participants should work to enable remote participation in IRTF events to
support those who cannot attend in person, and should aim to make materials
available online in a timely and broadly accessible manner.

The IRTF will work to provide travel grants, fee waivers, childcare, and
other support to help participation by students, early career researchers,
members of under-represented groups, those with disabilities, and others
who might otherwise be unable to participate. Participants are encouraged
to make use of these opportunities.

IRTF Research Groups may have open or limited membership [RFC2014].
Limited membership may be advantageous to the formation of the long-term
working relationships that are critical to successful collaborative research.
However, limited membership must be used with care and sensitivity to avoid
unnecessary fragmentation of the work of the research community.
The charter of each Research Group defines its membership policy (whether
open or limited), and the procedure to apply for membership in the group.
While limited membership is permitted, it is in no way encouraged or required.
Research Group Chairs must enforce the membership policy of their group in
a fair and transparent manner, providing a clear rationale for their decisions.
Participants with concerns about the administration of the membership policy
for a research group, or who wish to appeal a membership decision, should
raise their concern with the IRTF Chair.

In exceptional cases, advice from legal counsel may be to restrict an
individual from using IRTF IT systems and/or from participating in IRTF
research group meetings, open meetings, conferences, workshops, and other
events. In such cases, the IRTF Chair will act following the principles outlined in the
Statement on Restricting Access [RESTRICTING]. Due to the potential impact
on the standards process, arising from the use of shared infrastructure and
joint meetings between IRTF and IETF, any such action by the IRTF Chair
will only be taken in consultation with the IESG.


# Security Considerations

This IRTF code of conduct does not directly affect the security of the
Internet.

Research results, when translated into practice, have the potential to
significantly impact the security and privacy of users of the Internet.
Researchers should consider the potential security benefits, risks, and
implications of their work and, where possible, should aim to improve
security and protect the privacy of Internet users through their research
[RFC8890].


# IANA Considerations

This document requires no IANA actions.
